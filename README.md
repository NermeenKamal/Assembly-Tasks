- Tasks include:
  - Basic arithmetic operations
  - Array manipulation
  - String manipulation
  - Control structures (loops, conditional statements)
  - Function calls and parameter passing

### Technologies Used:
- MARS (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator)
- Assembly language

### How to Use:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Download the Mars4_4.jar program from the official website: http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/mars/
3. Open the Mars4_4.jar program.
4. Open the `.asm` files in the MARS simulator.
5. Assemble and run the code to see the results.

### Additional Information:
